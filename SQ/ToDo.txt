For Stack: stackclient is the source code that has main function and stack is the source code that has codes for stack
	and it uses element_struct source code.

For Queue: queueclient is the souce code that has main function and queue is the source code taht has codes for queue
	  and it uses element_class source code.



Stack uses element made up of structure and Queue uses element made up of class. 

You have to fill out stack and queue source files, not other files.

But if you think it is nessesary to fix other codes, you are allowed with giving sutable explanations. 

Good Luck!
